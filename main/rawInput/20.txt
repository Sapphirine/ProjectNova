Millions of monarch butterflies have arrived in Mexico s forests as part of their annual migration from Canada and the United States.
Conservationists are hoping that there will be an increase in the number of butterflies this year after dramatic falls in recent years.
Mexico, the US and Canada have all made efforts to increase butterfly numbers including developing an organic fertilizer which has been spread through the Oyamel Fir Forests of Mexico to protect the monarchs.
