     Assistant Manager Kenny McDowall will take over his duties until the end of the season,  Rangers said on their official website.

     We would like to thank Ally for all his hard work and dedication over the last few years, but we feel it is now in the best interests of all parties to move on. 

    Rangers were nine points behind Scottish Championship leaders Hearts when McCoist signalled his intention to leave and the Tynecastle side can extend their lead to 12 points if they beat Cowdenbeath on Tuesday.

    Bellshill-born McCoist was a Rangers player for 15 years as well as playing for St Johnstone, Sunderland, Kilmarnock and Scotland.

    He had been assistant manager at Ibrox under Walter Smith and stepped up as his successor in summer 2011 while Rangers were still in the Scottish Premier League.

    Administration and subsequent liquidation of the former company that ran the club resulted in Rangers playing in the fourth tier of Scottish football at the start of season 2012-13.

    A high turnover of players ensued and McCoist led the side to two consecutive league titles to get Rangers into this season s Championship.
