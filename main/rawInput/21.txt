Four cheetah cubs born at Prague zoo in November are doing well, according to keepers.
The four cubs have survived the most critical period after the birth and their mother, three-year-old Savannah, is taking good care of them, the zoo said.
Cheetahs are threatened with extinction in the wild, and the zoo s curator of mammals, Pavel Brendl, described the species as  lazy lovers  who need special attention to be encouraged to breed.
