The attack on schoolchildren, however, was repellent even in the eyes of other militant groups in the region.
A spokesman for the Afghan Taliban condemned the Peshawar school attack because it involved the  deliberate killing of innocent people, women and children. 
Osama Mehmood, a spokesman for al Qaeda s affiliate in India, similarly condemned the attack, blasting it as being against Sharia, or Islamic law.
 Our hearts are tearing apart with pain at the killing of innocent children,  he said in a statement.
 The fighters of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent condole the death of these children. Our target is not innocent civilians, women and children, instead we are responsible for their protection.
