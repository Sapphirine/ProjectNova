Inside, she said, there were garbage bags and a stuffed animal. She told affiliate KTXL that she also came upon a red sleeping bag with more bags inside.
She called the Placer County Sheriff s Office. Deputies said that while  investigating the contents of a container,  they  discovered the decomposing remains of a fetus or small infant. 
 You could tell it was a skull and a little jaw bone and hair,  Zimmer said.
Police say the container was taken to the county morgue, where authorities say they found  a second fetus or small infant  inside. Autopsies are being performed on both of the bodies.
Placer County Sheriff s Lt. John Poretti said the department was  trying to determine the age of the fetus, if it was a viable fetus. Or if it was a possible miscarriage. 
Police say detectives are interviewing a woman believed to be the mother. Charges against her are pending.
