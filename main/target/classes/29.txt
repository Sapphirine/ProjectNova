    Former Australia batsman Matthew Hayden has described the decision by England to continually overlook batsman Kevin Pietersen as  ludicrous .

None
    But Hayden, talking to BBC s Sportsweek programme, said:  It s ludicrous Kevin Pietersen is not in the England squad. 

    Speaking on Sunday, Pietersen said he remains  determined  to regain his England place. 

    Asked about Pietersen s absence from the 15-man World Cup squad announced on Saturday, Hayden said:  It s just crazy. World Cups are won on innovative batting.

    After releasing him from his central contract, ECB managing director Paul Downton told the BBC s Test Match Special that Pietersen had appeared  disinterested  and  distracted  during the fifth Test in Sydney.

    Asked about whether Pietersen may be recalled following Morgan s promotion to captain, Downton told the Telegraph:  We parted company with Kevin because throughout the ECB management, from the dressing room up to the board, it was felt that it was the right decision to go in a slightly different direction. 

    Pietersen, responded by tweeting:  Despite the rather disrespectful comments by Paul Downton and James Whitaker [ECB National Selector] yesterday, I remain determined to regain my England place!

     If anything more bridges have been burned by Kevin s book. There is no interest from our point of view in going backwards,  added Downton.

     We ve got an exciting group of young players and Eoin s excited to be working with those guys. He wants to fulfil that team s potential. 

    Pietersen is currently playing for Melbourne Stars in the Australian Big Bash Twenty20 competition, and hit 66 off 46 balls in their opening defeat to Adelaide Strikers.

     Going forward it is important he has some time away because he has looked a tired man these last few weeks,  said Giles 

     Whoever he trusts most, go and see them and work out how he s going to start scoring heavily again in Test cricket. We all know he has the ability but at the moment he is not playing very well. 

 I don t believe he ll ever play for England again. He s 35 in June and hasn t played a lot of meaningful cricket in the last 12 months. I understand the England players don t talk about Kevin Pietersen any more.
