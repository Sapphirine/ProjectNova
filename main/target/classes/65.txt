In August, police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, leading to protests in the town. Photographer Adrees Latif of Reuters talks about the frame shown here, in which he captured the moment a man is doused with milk and sprayed with mist after being hit with eye irritant from the security forces.
 As the evening rolled past midnight, I saw one man among the crowd who looked particularly agitated. He seemed to be a local resident, very upset with the police, and people were holding him back as he yelled towards the officers. 
 As he kept shouting, the police targeted him with some kind of eye irritant - it looked like pepper spray. He wasn t very close, but they got him right in the eye and his friends immediately pulled him to a parking lot nearby, where they poured milk on his face to flush away the effects of the spray.
 As they started to pour the milk, I began photographing and noticed a bright spotlight in the background. I believe it was from the police. At that point the people taking care of the man started spraying mist or water to further clear his eyes and I positioned my camera and used the light source to create a rim light around his head and bring attention to the droplets.
