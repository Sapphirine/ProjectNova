Cleaver says the photo was taken in Rugby, in Warwickshire (central England) in 1925 just after his grandparents Arnold and Helen Hogg got married. Fortunately for us, Arnold Hogg committed the rookie error of accidently including the pole in shot, preserving the evidence of his selfie stick for posterity.
 It s always been a favourite photo of the family,  Cleaver says.

BBC Trending reports on the rise of the  selfie stick . Just ignore the bit where we say they ve been around for about two years.
Cleaver says his grandfather was a renowned entertainer and a musician who played piano in a local cinema until his professional career was cut short by another technological innovation - the talking film. But he says Arnold Hogg, who died in 1972, wouldn t have been sore about missing out on any potential selfie-stick royalties.
 He d have loved the attention the photo is getting now, more than 100 years after his birth, because he was that sort of guy - very off the wall, very entertaining,  Cleaver says.  It s wonderful that the rest of the world is delighting in the humour of this situation.

 That said, amateur photographers have always been an incredibly inventive bunch of people,  he says.  There are lots and lots of examples over the years of amateurs devising all sorts of clever contraptions. 
Amateur box cameras of the 1920s would not have been able to capture an in-focus self-photo when held at arms length, he says, so selfie photographers then would have had to use a remote shutter device such as a cable, or else - as Arnold Hogg apparently did - build their own device.
