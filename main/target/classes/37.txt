Her professional dance partner Kovalev said of their journey:  I think we became real friends and I hope we will stay real friends. I could not imagine a better partner. 
All four competitors had the chance to perform their freestyle  showstopping  dance, with Flack and Kovalev s ambitious and theatrical routine winning high praise from the judging panel.
They also excelled in a Cha Cha Cha routine reprised from an earlier performance in the series, and chose to repeat a cheeky Turkish-themed Charleston which won them top marks.
Singer Simon Webbe and partner Kristina Rihanoff also gained high scores for both their initial performances, and were awarded a perfect 40 for their Argentine Tango.
All four couples performed a routine from the early stage of the competition picked by judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli, Darcey Bussell and Craig Revel Horwood in the first part of the live final.
Each couple were able improve the scores of routines first showcased in the initial weeks of the contest.
At the beginning of Saturday s second show, former The Only Way is Essex star Wright was announced as the contestant with the fewest viewer votes.
He was also the least highly-regarded by the judges, scoring 35 for both of his performances.
On leaving the show, he said that Strictly Come Dancing was  the best thing that anyone can ever do .
 I m never going to forget it, ever,  he added.
Flack, who has spin-off shows for The X Factor and I m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! was consistently a high scorer throughout the series, but was faced with one elimination dance-off but survived.
She also hit the headlines for reportedly being romantically attached to One Direction singer Harry Styles.
Despite losing out on the title, pop star Frankie Bridge s professional dance partner Kevin Clifton said that he was  insanely proud  of her achievements.

My wife and I both love Strictly Come Dancing. We ve watched every series since the beginning and the show just gets better and better each time but we would just love the BBC to get rid of the Sunday results show. Please just make Saturday night one big night of entertainment and just let the kids stay up late if they want to!
