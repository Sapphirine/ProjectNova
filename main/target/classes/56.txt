Israeli aircraft have bombed a site in Gaza, in the first such action since the declaration of a truce in August.
The air strike was carried out on a Hamas facility in response to a rocket fired earlier from Gaza, a statement from the Israeli military said.
Residents of the Khan Yunis area in Gaza reported hearing two explosions, the Associated Press news agency said.
The August truce ended seven weeks of fighting that killed more than 2,200 people - most of them Palestinians.

Lt Col Peter Lerner said the strike was in response to a rocket that landed in Eshkol, southern Israel, on Friday. 
The rocket struck an open field and did not cause any casualties or damage.
