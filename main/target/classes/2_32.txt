But if New York s taxpayers are indeed Zucker s patients, they should consider suing him for malpractice, because the new ban on hydraulic fracturing in New York has nothing to do with public health or good science. Instead, it s an anti-scientific, political decision that will harm the country as it panders to far-left environmentalists.
New York has become the first state with commercial gas reserves to ban a practice that has revolutionized the U.S. energy industry. Fracking injects sand water and small amounts of chemicals into deep oil- and gas-containing formations, cracking the rocks and allowing the trapped gas and oil to be recovered. Hydraulic fracturing has saved Americans billions of dollars, contributed to reduced U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and greatly bolstered the U.S. geopolitical position and America s energy security.

However, I am reflexively hostile to deception, especially when undertaken by people who cloak themselves in the mantle of science. And that s exactly what is happening here.

Of course, there are costs as well as benefits to fracking. And it is possible that at some point, new experience or information will come to light that would change our thinking. But we ve already fracked tens of thousands of U.S. wells, and the endorsements mentioned above come in full light of that experience.
Increased natural gas production could have brought billions of dollars and thousands of jobs to New York s hard-hit Southern Tier, which sits over the Marcellus Shale formation, one of America s richest potential sources of natural gas. Cuomo s ban will be particularly devastating for poor New Yorkers, who can now be expected to struggle with high home heating bills due to expensive imported gas.
Unfortunately, as supporters of the ban have realized, New York s move sends a signal to other states. But it also has geopolitical implications. The boom in hydraulic fracturing and tight oil production in the United States has helped undermine Russia s international standing by contributing to plummeting global oil prices. America s ability to produce and potentially export more natural gas could similarly reduce Russia s ability to leverage natural gas exports to Europe.
